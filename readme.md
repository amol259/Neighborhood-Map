This is an application that finds the top hotels in New york. Click on a marker to find the title and phone number of the hotel.

Api:
4 square
Google maps

To Run:
Download files
Click on index.html

Difficulties:
This project was difficult to begin with but once I got the overall architecture down, it started to make sense. I used 4square's api to get information
about the hotels through a api call. From there i used KO js to implement a filter that lists all hotels and filters based on text input. This part 
was quite difficult but after looking at many resources i was able to piece it together.
